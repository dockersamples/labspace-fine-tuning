# Validate and publish the model

Now that you have completed the fine-tuning process, you need to validate the fine-tuning. Then, you'll be ready to publish the model.


## ðŸ§ª Validate the model

Validating a model can be a lengthy process, as you want to ensure the model works for a variety of inputs it wasn't trained with.

For the purposes of this lab, you will simply run a new input against the model to validate it works as expected.

1. Load the GGUF model into Docker Model Runner by using the following `docker model package` command:

    ```bash
    docker model package --gguf $PWD/output/gemma-3-270m-it.F16.gguf demo/pii-tuned-model
    ```

    This will give the name `demo/pii-tuned-model` to the model

2. Validate the model is available with the Docker Model Runner by listing the model:

    ```bash
    docker model list
    ```

    This should give output similar to the following:

    ```plaintext no-copy-button
    MODEL NAME                   PARAMETERS  QUANTIZATION  ARCHITECTURE  MODEL ID      CREATED        SIZE       
    demo/pii-tuned-model:latest  268.10 M    MOSTLY_F16    gemma3        9c3eaf8a3dbd  2 minutes ago  511.46 MiB 
    ```

3. Send a new input against the model by using the `docker model run` command:

    ```bash
    docker model run demo/pii-tuned-model "Mask all PII in the following text. Replace each entity with the exact UPPERCASE label in square brackets (e.g., [PERSON], [EMAIL], [PHONE], [USERNAME], [ADDRESS], [CREDIT_CARD], [TIME], etc.). Preserve all non-PII text, whitespace, ' ' and punctuation exactly. Return ONLY the redacted text. Text: This is an example of text that contains some data. The author of this text is Ignacio LÃ³pez Luna, but everybody calls him Ignasi. His ID number is 123456789. He has a son named Arnau LÃ³pez, who was born on 21-07-2021"
    ```

    You should get output similar to the following now:

    ```plaintext no-copy-button
    This is an example of text that contains some data. The author of this text is [GIVENNAME_1] [SURNAME_1], but everybody calls him [GIVENNAME_1]. His ID number is [IDCARDNUM_1]. He has a son named [GIVENNAME_1] [SURNAME_1], who was born on [DATEOFBIRTH_1]
    ```

Hooray! It looks like your model is working as expected!



## ðŸ“¦ Publish the model

There are a variety of ways you can publish your model. By using the `docker model package` command, you will package the model as an OCI (Open Container Initiative) Artifact. This provides a few benefits:

- Distribute the model using the same registries you use for your container images
- The same credentials that pull container images will pull your models, simplifying deployment setups
- This artifact can be easily used by the Docker Model Runner

1. To publish your model, run the following command after swapping `DOCKER_USERNAME` with your username:

    ```bash no-run-button
    docker model package --gguf $PWD/output/gemma-3-270m-it.F16.gguf DOCKER_USERNAME/pii-tuned-model --push
    ```

    You should notice this command is the same as what you ran before but with a different name and the addition of the `--push` flag.
